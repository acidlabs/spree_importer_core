SpreeImporterCore
=================

Spree Importer engine. Adds an easy way to massively load  different Spree models, the way you need it.

Installation
------------

_spree\_importer\_core_ supports:

+ Ruby 2.1+
+ Rails 4.2+
+ Spree 3.0+

Add _spree\_importer\_core_ to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree_importer_core'
```

`bundle install` your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rails g spree:importer_core:install
```

Note: `SpreeImporterCore` uses `ActiveJob` for background processing. You may want to specify an adapter before importing, otherwise the job is immediately executed.

Usage
-----

You can generate an importer file running

```ruby
rails g spree:importer_core:importer Thing
```

This will generate the needed files in order to make the importer to work as intended.

- Create new *importer* file
- Insert importer locales for new *importer* class
- Add *sample* importer template
- And, update *importers* list

Then, just restart your rails server

### New importer Class

The new importer class will be placed at `lib/spree_importer_core/thing_importer.rb`

Importer behavior must be defined in order to correctly import spreadsheet rows. e.g: Updating stock

```ruby
class Spree::ThingImporter < Spree::ImporterCore::BaseImporter
  # Load a file and the get data from each file row
  def load_data(row:)
    sku = row[0]
    stock = row[1]
    if variant = Spree::Variant.find_by(sku: sku)
   	  stock_item = Spree::StockItem.find_by variant_id: variant.id
      stock_item.update_attribute(:count_on_hand, stock)
    end
  end
end
```

Note: you can give the importer any name you want, thou it is highly recommended to give one that describes its content


### Locales

Locales will be placed at `config/spree_importer_core.en.yml`

```
en:
  spree:
    spree_importer_core:
      importers:
        thing:
          title: Thing Importer
          name: Thing
```

Every importer needs `title` for views and `name` for the menu


### Add sample importer template

`ImporterCore` create a sample importer template at `lib/spree_importer_core/templates/`, you need to replace with their correct content. In the last example, file be called `thing.xlsx`.



### Importer List

`ImporterCore` defines a list with the available importers, you may want to add or remove your own importers. Remember to make your classes to inherit from `Spree::ImporterCore::BaseImporter`, otherwise needed methods won't be defined.

Edit `config/initializers/spree.rb` to define/modify the available importers.


```ruby
Spree::ImporterCore::Config.importers << Spree::ThingImporter
```


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will build the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by running `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your application you will want to use its factories. Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree/importer_core/factories'
```
